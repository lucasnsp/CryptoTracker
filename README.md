## Architecture

The UpYou app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern to separate concerns and maintain a clean and organized codebase:

- **Model**: Represents the data of the app to decode after to display in the view and comunicate with the viewModel.

- **View**: Represents the user interface layer using UIKit views to display the data of the App.

- **ViewModel**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and View, responsible for handling data manipulation, business logic, and interaction with external services.
